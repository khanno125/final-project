How it impacts everyday life
Everyone experiences stress, which is your body's physical and emotional response to new or challenging situations.1 This can occur when you face problems such as those related to work, school, health, and relationships. Feeling stress can be a normal coping response and can forge a healthy sense of our ability to solve problems. However, when the stress is long term, known as chronic stress, it can lead to worsening health problems.2
Stress can cause the following:
* Feelings of fear, anger, sadness, worry, numbness, or frustration
* Changes in appetite, energy, desires, and interests
* Trouble concentrating and making decisions
* Nightmares or problems sleeping
* Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, or skin rashes
* Worsening of chronic health problems and mental health conditions
* Increased use of alcohol, drugs, and other substances
Healthy ways to cope with stress
Learning to cope in a healthy way can help reduce your stress. Taking small steps in your daily life to manage stress can have a big impact. Everyone manages stress differently. You can find and manage what triggers your stress and the right combination of healthy techniques that work for you.
Take care of your mind.
* Take breaks from news and social media. It is good to be informed, but constant information about negative events can be upsetting.3
* Make time to unwind.
o Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate.
o Keep a journal.
o Spend time outdoors either being active or relaxing.
o Try to do some other relaxing activities you enjoy.
* Practice gratitude daily. Remind yourself of specific things you are grateful for and write them down.4
* Connect with others.
o Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.
o Connect with your community-based or faith-based organizations.
Gratitude works

Gratitude may be the best kept secret to help reduce stress and feel better. Practicing gratitude every day can improve your physical and emotional well-being. 
Take care of your body.
* Get enough sleep. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day to help you sleep better. Adults need 7 or more hours per night.5
* Move more. Staying physically healthy can improve your emotional well-being. Every little bit of physical activity helps.
o Start small and build up to 2 1/2 hours a week.
o Break it into smaller amounts such as 20 to 30 minutes a day.
* Eat healthy. Have fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat or no-fat dairy. Limit foods with unhealthy fats, salt, and added sugars. See Healthy Eating Tips.
* Limit alcohol intake. Choose not to drink, or drink in moderation on days you drink alcohol. Moderation means:
o 2 drinks or less a day for men.
o 1 drink or less for women.
