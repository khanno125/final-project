Mental health is essential to our overall well-being and as important as physical health. When we feel mentally well, we can work productively, enjoy our free time, and contribute actively to our communities.
This page provides resources to help you keep mentally healthy and to reduce stress. We hope you will find them useful. In cases of mental distress, the first step is to talk to someone you trust. If you feel you need it, seek help from a professional.
